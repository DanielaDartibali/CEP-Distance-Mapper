# CEP-Distance-Mapper
This project automates the geolocation of Brazilian postal codes (CEPs) using Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) and calculates the geodesic distance from each address to a fixed workplace location. It handles missing coordinates using ViaCEP as a fallback and generates a final CSV file with latitude, longitude, and distance in kilometers.
